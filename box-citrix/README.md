Either run `sh build-distrobox.sh` or `sh build-toolbox.sh`.

The "export" step in the latter case is done with the extra `export-tbox.sh` script, which was a quick hack really. I suppose someone has already built a decent export tool for toolbox, I might look to find it and start using that instead, but right now distrobox does just fine.

If using toolbox, the only thing needed is to right-click on the downloaded file (when accessing your Citrix workspace) and choose to "Open With..." selecting the exported toolbox app (Citrix Workspace). Mark to "always open files of this type" so you never have to open them manually in the future.
